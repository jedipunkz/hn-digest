Not so long ago, I experimented on so-called Generative AI using an
external eGPU and Slackware
Linux
.
Because I’m a BSD fanboy, I started looking at doing the same on FreeBSD.
But I faced a lot of missing dependencies issues and Python compilation errors.
As a non fluent Python person, I couldn’t solve all the errors I
encountered and decided to see if the FreeBSD Linux Binary
Compatibility
feature would be able to achieve the goal; after all, there are people using
it to watch DRM stuff from the Clouds.
Spoiler alert : it does work given an organized small amount of
command line spells.
Feel free to jump to the next section if you don’t care about AI
opinions ;-)
These days, AI is sold (and forced) everywhere. I am not the last to
yell at Mozilla for pushing some shit into Firefox. I’m also pretty sure
vibe coding
is a bad idea.
I have tested things like ChatGPT for a few things. Asking for help to
debug error messages lead nowhere but to Stack Overflow and Unix & Linux
Stack Exchange. Asking for pre-made code offered mostly non-working
stuff but I must admit it gave me ideas by identifying features from
software I didn’t know. Asking for product comparison was more or less
an extract of Tom’s Hardware or Les Numériques. Asking for differences
between technology A and B and better use cases felt approximate enough
that I usually ended up sending words to SearXNG in order to get more
informations.
I also tested the Bing Image Generator; although I’m aware of the global
harvesting of copyrighted data this implied. My opinion was that it was
not as good as it was sold. It was about the same quality as child-me
collecting free cliparts, colouring in Paint and organising in
Designer…
All in all, my take is that AI is not Artificial Intelligence. It’s not
intelligence at all, yet. At best, it is Algorithm Induce. At worse, it
is Aleatory Inference. And most of all, Machine Learning, Neural
Networks and LLMs are not the same thing.
I hate the Big Tech’s AI because they are thieves and liars. But I am
still interested in the local software that can provide features other
software don’t yet. And this is why I keep an eye on running stuff like
Python Torch. I have not yet looked at LLaMA. To paraphrase some Monday
meme, my take is that You don’t hate AI. You hate LLMs in the context
of capitalism and patriarchy.
There are quite a few bricks to assemble here. There may be smarter way
but I have not found any all-in-one documentation. So I settled on
choices based on my (lack of) knowledge.
The OS is installed without particular requirements. I install software
using binary packages as much as possible.
The FreeBSD NVIDIA drivers are installed and configured first. When
everything seems to be working, the Linux Binary Compatibility part can
begin.
There is a need to have NVIDIA Linux libraries available. Because it has
to be the same version as the FreeBSD ones, I installed the dedicated
package. From there, you get a /compat/linux directory with a fairly
basic Rocky Linux 9.7 installation. It is bare enough to not ship with a
package manager.
As I have to install more software in the Linux userland, I’m using a
temporary RL9 installation to grab dnf packages that will be installed
in the /compat/linux directory. This allows installing some more
software in an easy way - dealing with binary packages and
dependencies. There is a dnf package in FreeBSD ports but I never
understood how to use it with /compat/linux .
Using the dnf package manager, I installed various required tools and
libraries for later usage.
I grabbed, compiled and installed Python 3.10 into the /compat/linux
directory. Mostly because this version seem to be the one all the tools
I tested need.
The I installed a few additional NVIDIA / CUDA tools and librairies inside
/compat/linux . There is also a specific NVIDIA Unified Memory (UVM)
program to install in order to use the NVIDIA GPU from with Linuxulator.
Finally, a bunch of Python virtual environments can be populated to use
PyTorch based-software.
As described in details
here
,
I am using an NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti, connected via a Thunderbolt eGPU
docking station to a Topton GM1 head-less machine.
The BIOS is configured with “No Security” so that the hardware is
recognised automatically.
I have done all my trial & errors on a ThinkPad T480s running FreeBSD
14.3. It went the same way as my final configuration using FreeBSD 14.4
on the Topton. I didn’t go for 15.0 as I already had two bad experience
with it on different projects and I see a lot of people on the Fediverse
having issues with 15 too.
Install and update FreeBSD 14.4/amd64.
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
Everything else will be done remotely using SSH.
For some reasons, FreeBSD doesn’t support eGPU hotplug on the ThinkPad.
The NVIDIA card has to be powered on and connected to the computer when
it boots FreeBSD. This may change in the future.
The Handbook explains how to install the NVIDIA FreeBSD
drivers
.
# pkg install -y nvidia-drm-kmod
# pkg info | grep nvidia
nvidia-driver-580.119.02_1 NVidia graphics card binary drivers for hardware OpenGL rendering

nvidia-kmod-580.119.02.1404000_1 kmod part of NVidia graphics card binary drivers for hardware OpenGL rendering
# sysrc kld_list+=nvidia-drm
During my testing period, the meta package installed incompatible
versions of the serveral NVIDIA stuff. So I had to force installation of
the proper version. For the record, this went like this:
# pkg -N install nvidia-drm-kmod
(...)
nvidia-driver: 580.95.05 [FreeBSD]
nvidia-drm-61-kmod: 580.95.05.1403000 [FreeBSD]

nvidia-kmod: 580.95.05.1403000 [FreeBSD]
(...)
A reboot was performed to ensure I configured everything properly. The
NVIDIA card was luckily identified and connected properly.

Side note for dual GPU configuration
While trying to have all the following working, I used a laptop with an
embedded Intel GPU. But when I booted with the NVIDIA eGPU connected,
Xorg would detect it and use it as the primary display device. And
because nothing was connected to the NVIDIA card output, I went blind on
the laptop. To force Xorg to not use the NVIDIA GPU at all, I had to
create a dedicated configuration snippet. This way, I was still able to
run Xfce on the Intel GPU using the laptop monitor and the NVIDIA GPU
for the Torch things.

Linux Binary Compatibility
Reading the Handbook Chapter 12. Linux Binary
Compatibility
is
probably a good idea.
For the moment, I just needed to enable linux(4) binary compatibility:
# service linux enable
# service linux start
This creates the /compat/linux directory and mount the required file systems.
# mount | grep linux
linprocfs on /compat/linux/proc (linprocfs, local)
linsysfs on /compat/linux/sys (linsysfs, local)
devfs on /compat/linux/dev (devfs)
fdescfs on /compat/linux/dev/fd (fdescfs)
tmpfs on /compat/linux/dev/shm (tmpfs, local)
Temporary Rocky Linux 9
A temporary RL9 instance is deployed on the server. I used the 9.7
version as this is the one available in the ports. It is based on an OCI
image and is only used to easily grab all the packages required to
install the dnf package manager in /compat/linux .
Grab the RL97 container image and deploy in a temporary location:
# fetch https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9.7/images/x86_64/Rocky-9-Container-Base.latest.x86_64.tar.xz
# mkdir Rocky-9 /tmp/rl97
# tar xf Rocky-9-Container-Base.latest.x86_64.tar.xz -C Rocky-9/
# find Rocky-9/blobs/sha256 -type f -exec tar xpzf {} -C /tmp/rl97 \; 2>/dev/null
# cp -p /etc/resolv.conf /etc/hosts /tmp/rl97/etc/
# chroot /tmp/rl97 /bin/bash -l
Update the Rocky Linux system and grab the required dnf packages:
# update-ca-trust
# dnf --releasever 9.7 -y update
# dnf --releasever 9.7 -y install python3-dnf-plugin-modulesync
# dnf --releasever 9.7 -y download --resolve --alldeps --downloaddir ~/DNF dnf
# exit
Back on the FreeBSD host, we have all the stuff available to manage
packages in /compat/linux .
When using the ports packages, several Linux distributions can be used.
The NVIDIA Linux libraries will deploy a bare Rocky Linux 9.7 system
inside /compat/linux . The rpm package is used to deploy the dnf
packages we previously grabbed into /compat/linux .
# pkg install -y linux-nvidia-libs rpm4
# cd /compat/linux
# for f in /tmp/rl97/root/DNF/*rpm; do rpm2cpio < "$f" | cpio -id; done
# cp -p /etc/resolv.conf /etc/hosts /compat/linux/etc/
# chroot /compat/linux /bin/bash -l
# update-ca-trust
# dnf --releasever 9.7 -y update
# exit
From there, the /compat/linux directory contains the NVIDIA librairies
and a package manager suitable to add more things to the Linux instance.
Don’t forget to remove the temporary instance as we should not need it
anymore.
All the PyTorch software I tested recommand (if not require) Python
3.10. But because of RedHat policy, this version is not available as
binary packages. AFAIK.
Luckily, it can still be build from sources and installed in the Linux
directory.
# chroot /compat/linux /bin/bash -l
# dnf --releasever 9.7 -y install gcc make tar wget \
bzip2-devel libffi-devel openssl-devel xz-devel zlib-devel
# cd /root
# wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.19/Python-3.10.19.tgz
# tar xzf Python-3.10.19.tgz
# cd Python-3.10.19
# ./configure --enable-optimizations
# make -j $(nproc)
# make altinstall
# python3.10 -V
Python 3.10.19
# pip3.10 -V
pip 23.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip (python 3.10)
# exit
Python 3.10 is now available inside /compat/linux and can be used to
deploy virtual environments for PyTorch applications.
