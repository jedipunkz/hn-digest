Open, reproducible benchmark for LLM routing efficiency — how close a routing
policy gets to the ideal quality-per-dollar frontier. Apache-2.0.
Prior art: RouterBench (Martian, arXiv:2403.12031). OmnisBench differs by being
live, cost-current, and continuously re-gradable ( omnisbench verify ).
⚠️ Security warning: untrusted code execution
omnisbench run executes untrusted, model-generated Python in order to grade
code tasks (the code_unittest grader). The v0 sandbox ( src/omnisbench/graders/sandbox.py )
provides a fresh subprocess, a hard timeout, and a throwaway working directory —
but it does NOT provide network isolation, filesystem isolation, or memory/
resource limits. A malicious or buggy model response can still make outbound
network calls, read/write anything the host process can reach, or exhaust host
resources within the timeout window.
Run omnisbench run inside a container or a disposable VM. Full sandbox
hardening (network egress blocking, filesystem jail, resource limits) is a
tracked v1 item — it is not implemented yet, and no test in this repo asserts
isolation the code does not actually provide.
omnisbench verify does not execute untrusted code from a live model — it only
re-runs graders (including code_unittest , so the same untrusted-code caveat
above applies to the response text already stored in results.json ) against
already-published, static data. The same sandboxing caveat applies: verify a
results.json you don't trust inside a container/VM too.
Headline results (run 2026-08-20)
The number that matters is the fresh split : LiveCodeBench problems published after the models'
training cutoff, so none of them can be sitting in the training data. That is where routing has to
earn its keep.
Fresh split, 15 tasks. Pool: claude-opus-5 , gpt-5 , claude-haiku-4-5 , gpt-5-nano . Pricing
snapshot config/pricing/2026-08-18.yaml , output budget 16,384 tokens. Full artifacts in
runs/fresh-16k-2026-08-20/ .
On problems the models cannot have memorised, ideal routing hits 93.3% , above the frontier
model's 86.7%, at roughly 60% lower cost than always calling it. No single model solves every
fresh problem, so routing to the best model per item beats any fixed choice on quality and price at
once. That is the prize, and it only shows up once the data is clean.
For contrast, the same policies on the likely-contaminated split (HumanEval + GSM8K, 20 tasks)
all land near 100% quality: the models have seen those problems, every policy looks equally
good, and routing appears to save nothing. That flatness is an artefact of contamination. An earlier
contaminated-only run reported exactly that as a headline (oracle at 99.7%), which was misleading,
so the fresh split now leads.
The sample is small. 15 fresh tasks is a pilot that shows the method and the direction, not a
final verdict. Widening the fresh set is the roadmap.
oracle is the theoretical ceiling of routing, chosen after the fact per item, not a
shippable router. The gap between a real router and oracle is the real scorecard.
Every figure re-derives offline: omnisbench verify runs/fresh-16k-2026-08-20 re-runs the graders
against the published responses and rebuilds this table with zero API calls .
The larger contaminated-only baseline (HumanEval 164 + GSM8K 200) still lives in runs/2026-08-19/
for reference; its numbers are pinned near 100% for the reason above.
Reproduce (needs OPENAI_API_KEY + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY , pip install datasets for LiveCodeBench,
and a container per the warning above):
pip install -e .
python scripts/prepare_datasets.py
python -m omnisbench.cli run --config configs/fresh-run.yaml --run runs/mine
python -m omnisbench.cli report --run runs/mine
python -m omnisbench.cli verify --run runs/mine # zero-API re-grade of the published results
Contamination and splits
HumanEval and GSM8K are old and widely republished, so the pool models have very likely seen the
graded examples. That can lift the absolute quality numbers and distort the per-model gap that
routing exploits, which was a fair point raised by readers. OmnisBench now reports it directly
instead of hiding it.
Each dataset carries a contamination tag in config ( likely_contaminated , fresh , or the
default unknown ). A run then produces, on top of the overall leaderboard:
A leaderboard per split. The same policies are scored separately on the likely-contaminated
tasks and on any fresh tasks, so you can see whether the routing story holds where the models
could not have memorised the answer. The headline run ( runs/fresh-16k-2026-08-20 ) carries both,
15 fresh and 20 likely-contaminated; the original configs/v0.yaml suite is entirely
likely_contaminated , and its board says so.
Frontier escape rate per policy. The fraction of a policy's requests that went to the
frontier (most expensive) model. It is 0% for the cheap floor, 100% for always-frontier, and for
a real router it is the escalation rate. This is the number that tends to drift once prompts get
messier than a benchmark.
Release-date margins per split. For any split whose tasks carry a release date (the
LiveCodeBench fresh set does), results.json records the date spread under date_margins : the
count, min, median and max date. That lets a reader judge how fresh the split is from the actual
dates, not a bare tag. Set training_cutoff in the config to also report how many days past it the
split sits. A binary contaminated-or-clean call hides how close to the line the pool runs.
All three are re-derived from the stored items by omnisbench verify , so a faked split number,
escape rate or date margin fails verification the same way a tampered answer does.
Contamination probe (perturbation gap)
The split labels and date margins are still a judgement. The perturbation-gap probe measures it. Score
each model on the original problems and on reworded copies that keep the test cases identical, then
publish the drop per model per split. A model that relied on the exact wording scores lower when it
changes, so a large gap flags contamination for that model on that set, and a gap near zero means the
score was earned. It re-grades offline like the rest of the run. Full method in
docs/perturbation-probe.md .
Run it with omnisbench probe . Because the pool spans two providers and a rewriter isn't neutral to
all of it, we reword the whole pool with two generators, claude-sonnet-5 ( runs/probe-sonnet-24-2026-08-25 )
and gpt-5 ( runs/probe-gpt5-24-2026-08-25 ), and read each model's gap under each. A validation pass
drops any rewording no model can solve. On 24 fresh problems, gpt-5 gives up about 20 points under
either rewriter, a wording-reliance signal that survives changing the rewriter. Every other model's gap
swings with who did the rewording (the Anthropic models drop about 6 points under gpt-5 and 20 to 40
under sonnet, and gpt-5-nano does the reverse), so at 15 to 17 validated tasks the rewriter moves the
number more than the model does. What holds across the board: every model loses at least 6 points when
a fresh problem is reworded, so a post-cutoff date is necessary and not sufficient. Full matrix and both
source runs in docs/perturbation-probe.md .
Adding a fresh, contamination-resistant split
A fresh split filters a dated dataset down to problems published after the models' training cutoff.
The livecodebench loader ( kind: livecodebench ) pulls LiveCodeBench, keeps the stdin/stdout
problems, stamps each task's release date, and min_date filters to the fresh ones. The
livecodebench grader runs each solution against the problem's test cases in the same sandbox as
the HumanEval grader, and omnisbench verify re-grades them offline. See
configs/livecodebench-fresh.example.yaml for a
runnable config; it needs pip install datasets , provider keys, and a paid run to produce numbers.
The headline run in runs/fresh-16k-2026-08-20/ is one such run, built from configs/fresh-run.yaml .
Next on the roadmap: LiveCodeBench functional problems (implement-a-named-function), which are
skipped for now, and reading its compressed private test cases.
omnisbench verify re-runs the graders against the published per-item
responses and re-derives the full leaderboard (quality + cost) with zero API
calls — anyone can reproduce and audit the numbers from results.json alone.
Open, reproducible benchmark for LLM routing efficiency: verify routing-savings claims yourself. On a fresh split the models can't have memorised, ideal routing beats the frontier model at about 60% lower cost, and every number re-grades offline. Apache-2.0.
