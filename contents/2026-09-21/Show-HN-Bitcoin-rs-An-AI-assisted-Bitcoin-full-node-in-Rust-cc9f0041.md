Description: Bitcoin full node implementation in Rust. Contribute to gosuda/bitcoin-rs development by creating an account on GitHub.
HN text: I’m building bitcoin-rs, an independent Bitcoin full node in Rust, using AI aggressively for implementation. I think Bitcoin is a particularly good target for AI-era development because implementations can be verified against strong external references. In bitcoin-rs, I use libbitcoinkernel as one of the main compatibility oracles.

Benchmarks and limitations
Bitcoin Core is the most successful
implementation of Bitcoin. Its conservatism, stability, and compatibility
discipline are major reasons for
that success. Over time, however, those safeguards also shape which changes are
practical: existing boundaries accumulate dependencies, and implementation
choices harden into assumptions that Bitcoin consensus does not require.
bitcoin-rs asks a simple question:
If a Bitcoin full node were designed again today, what would we keep, and
what would we change?
AI is changing how software is built. Work that once required large teams and
long development cycles can now be attempted by much smaller teams with far
faster iteration. Bitcoin is unusually well suited to this model because
implementations can be checked against Bitcoin Core, libbitcoinkernel ,
historical chain data, consensus test vectors, fuzzing, and differential tests.
Bitcoin is well suited to AI-native development; Bitcoin Core's development
culture is not. Its review process prioritizes minimizing change risk,
rewarding incrementalism, entrenching existing boundaries, and making radical
architectural experimentation prohibitively expensive.
That is why we built bitcoin-rs : to preserve Bitcoin's consensus while
making bold architectural experimentation practical—build alternatives,
verify them against reproducible evidence, and keep iterating until better
designs emerge.
Performance is a first-class requirement. bitcoin-rs is not aiming for
parity with Bitcoin Core simply by changing languages. Synchronization,
storage, memory ownership, concurrency, caching, I/O, and indexing can all be
reconsidered. Improvements must be demonstrated with matched whole-node
benchmarks against Core.
The UTXO set is the node's authoritative coin state. Much of the Bitcoin
application ecosystem grew by rebuilding or duplicating wallet-, Electrum-,
and explorer-specific views around the same chain data. bitcoin-rs
simplifies that boundary: the node owns the canonical UTXO set used for
validation and an integrated script index exposed through Esplora-compatible
APIs. This eliminates the need for a separate Electrum server with its own
duplicate chain state and ingestion pipeline.
Wallet-specific keys, policies, and metadata remain outside the node.
Consumers build on node state; they do not redefine where Bitcoin's coin
state lives.
Modularity keeps the core isolated and components composable. Clear
dependency and failure boundaries keep extensions from destabilizing
validation or chainstate while allowing components to be reused independently.
Extensions own their state and lifecycle and may build on core capabilities,
but they do not become dependencies of the core.
Rust-native integration is a primary path. Applications and extensions in
the Rust Bitcoin ecosystem can attach to the node as typed, in-process
components instead of routing through serialized RPC or separate processes.
This improves runtime efficiency and simplifies integration and deployment,
making the full node a native, composable part of the ecosystem.
Bitcoin is not defined by the continued preservation of one codebase. The code
can change; consensus is what must remain. bitcoin-rs aims to challenge
Bitcoin Core and build a better Bitcoin implementation. That challenge
strengthens the Bitcoin ecosystem: a separately designed codebase cross-checks
consensus interpretation, increases implementation diversity, and reduces the
risk of correlated implementation failures.
Consensus validation: the native Rust interpreter verifies Legacy, SegWit v0,
and Taproot key-path and script-path spends. Core's committed script_tests ,
tx_valid , and tx_invalid vectors pin zero native mismatches. Script checks
run in parallel across rayon workers with sighash midstate reuse per
transaction. --features kernel routes the same checks through
libbitcoinkernel (Bitcoin Core's C++ engine) as an independent oracle.
Kernel feature: --features kernel enables libbitcoinkernel . The
crates/consensus and crates/node library crates still default to kernel ;
the bin/bitcoin-rs binary defaults to ["fjall", "redb", "zmq"] (no kernel)
and does not link libbitcoinkernel . Issue #213 keeps that split until
native wins the signed-spend and full-replay gates; see the
validation-default contract .
Pure-Rust storage defaults: LSM-tree storage backed by fjall by default,
with redb compiled in and rocksdb available through an optional Cargo
feature.
Sharded UTXO cache: a 256-shard in-memory UTXO set ( hashbrown::HashTable of
compact records behind parking_lot::RwLock ) with checkpoint-based crash
recovery and effective --dbcache-mb budget allocation.
Asynchronous index consumer: txindex reconciles over a monotonic chain
snapshot and event hint channel without blocking block validation.
Integrated ScriptIndex and Esplora APIs: address and scripthash UTXO indexing
and confirmed transaction history served directly over HTTP.
Mempool mutation gateway: centralized mutation tracking publishing ordered
accept and remove events over ZMQ pubsequence .
Block template assembly: mining candidate generation via getblocktemplate .
Core-compatible RPC and typed embedding: synchronous HTTP JSON-RPC using Core
method names and wire formats (walletless, no private keys), plus a typed
async Node embedding API for in-process Rust integrations.
Build and run the kernel-free default binary with the quick-start profile.
Consult Getting started for build lanes and
prerequisites before choosing features:
cargo build --profile quickstart -p bitcoin-rs
./target/quickstart/bitcoin-rs --data-dir .bitcoin-rs
Use the quickstart profile for initial exploration. For sustained IBD or
benchmarking, use cargo build --release -p bitcoin-rs and record the exact
profile and feature set with the result. No build-time ratio is claimed here.
This starts a mainnet node storing state in .bitcoin-rs and listening for
JSON-RPC on 127.0.0.1:8332 .
Verify the node is responding and syncing:
curl -s --user bitcoin-rs:bitcoin-rs \
-H ' content-type: application/json ' \
-d ' {"jsonrpc":"1.0","id":"1","method":"getblockchaininfo","params":[]} ' \
http://127.0.0.1:8332/
Kernel oracle build
To route script verification through libbitcoinkernel instead of the native
interpreter, install C++ dependencies ( cmake and libboost-dev on
Debian/Ubuntu), then pass --features kernel :
cargo build --release -p bitcoin-rs --features kernel
./target/release/bitcoin-rs --data-dir .bitcoin-rs
Benchmark status
End-to-end synchronization evidence is the
owner of methodology, measurements, artifact custody, and limitations. It
retains historical bounded results from superseded engines, including both
faster local replays and slower daemon IBD results. Those figures are not
current end-state proof or a general speed comparison with Bitcoin Core.
The owner's end-state cells are marked planned_not_executed . Historical raw
JSON was retired by #224; retained digests can identify an external copy, but
are not a replacement for the raw evidence. This README makes no current
performance-superiority claim. Consult the owner document for the status of
each workload before quoting a result.
