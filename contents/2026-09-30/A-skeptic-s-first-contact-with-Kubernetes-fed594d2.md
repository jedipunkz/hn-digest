A skeptic's first contact with Kubernetes
Mumbling about computers
A skeptic's first contact with Kubernetes
I've been working on systems administration / engineering / infrastructure development for many years and
somehow I've managed to avoid any interaction with Kubernetes. This avoidance wasn't accidental; my work required very tight control of workload placement in physical locations.
Over time, I developed a skeptical view of Kubernetes without really having a solid basis for it, other than a vague notion of it being "a new way of doing things" and "unnecessary complexity".
I decided it was time to base my opinions on facts rather than perception, so here I am, writing what I learned.
While there are a lot of tutorials covering the usage and operation of a Kubernetes cluster, along with basic descriptions of its components, they did not quite work for me. Many of these resources lightly cover what the components do, but often miss the underlying reason or the tradeoffs.
This post aims to cover these concepts from a perspective I would've found useful, and it does not aim to be exhaustive.
Kubernetes allows you to run arbitrary workloads, and provides you with the ability to:
specify requirements (cpu, disk, memory, instance count, ..)
dynamically scale instance count
but the more important part, is what it does for you:
picking which host an application runs on
"self-healing" (crashed instances get restarted, instances automatically moved out of faulty hosts)
exposes services for DNS-based discovery
and it only requires you to package your workload as a Docker image , which seems like a reasonable price to pay.
The basic building blocks that compose a cluster can be defined as follows:
Pod : a unit of work, consisting of a set of Docker images and their configuration
Node : a computer running the kubernetes node agent (kubelet). executes Pods.
Cluster ; a logical collection of Node s along with the Control Plane.
Service : logical grouping of a set of pods
Namespace : a logical subdivision of the Cluster . provides scope for names (like DNS search domain)
It's easier to observe the relationship between these concepts in diagram form:
While this may be an OK -ish explanation, it wasn't really something that would've been useful for me – a lot of infrastructure platforms look something like this diagram; there's nothing special here
My opinion is that a large part of Kubernetes' value is derived from just two concepts:
Workloads are managed by a set of control loops (named Controllers ).
A control loop will continuously perform actions (via a control element), if necessary, to achieve a desired state , and it will do this by observing specific variables (via a sensor).
An interesting detail is that the control element does not necessarily directly affect what the sensor observes.
This description is very generic, so here are some examples:
A workload that needs to process events from a queue
Desired state: empty queue
Control Element: number of event processing servers
A workload that needs to horizontally scale to handle user load
Desired state: Maintain P90 latency below X ms
Sensor: Latency metrics from backend
Control Element: Spin up new Pods to handle the demand
Generic Health monitoring
Desired state: All Nodes are healthy
Sensor: Health metrics from nodes
Control Element: Remove Nodes from the cluster
A Service is a networking-level concept which provides stable access to a set of backing Pods, it offers:
A stable identity : unchanging (virtual) IP address & a DNS record
Load balancing: distributes incoming traffic across the Pods
Service discovery: allows other components to find and communicate with the Service
Compared to "classic" clusters, a Service provides a similar abstraction to the combination of:
N nodes running Keepalived + NGINX (with a dynamic set of backends)
CNAME records for the virtual (Keepalived) IP
Whenever a new Service is created:
A Virtual IP will be assigned to it
Every Node will update its networking configuration ( netfilter ) to forward any packet destined to each Service's Virtual IP instead to the backing Pods.
The networking configuration is updated by a Controller that runs on every Node: kube-proxy , whose primary responsibility is to watch the state of all Service objects and update the netfilter rules on every change.
This design means that all Nodes act as load balancers for Service traffic, so there is no single point of failure in Service traffic forwarding, and that traffic forwarding capacity scales with Cluster size.
For me, an interesting property of this design is that every Node receives the rules for every Service, which has some implications:
Very simple implementation for kube-proxy
The number of rules may be large, which may be problematic for certain traffic forwarding implementations ( iptables linearly evaluates every rule)
Traffic is forwarded multiple times in some scenarios, providing higher availability at the cost of extra load on the cluster
When a Pod is moved to another node, the traffic will be forwarded twice until the old DNS entry expires
No need to deal with cache invalidation for DNS entries at the kube-proxy level
Misbehaving clients (eg: ones that do not re-resolve DNS before reconnecting) will continue to work
We can look at the life of a packet that travels from "Pod 1" to "Service 1":
or "how, when and where things run"
You can create a Pod manually, using a YAML definition like this one:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Pod
metadata :
name : nginx
spec :
containers :
- name : nginx
image : nginx:1.14.2
ports :
- containerPort : 80
but by doing that, you are manually scheduling the execution of this pod once ; which is easy, but has some nasty limitations:
If the Node that host the Pod dies, the Pod will not get re-scheduled
If the Pod is terminated due to resource pressure on the Node (via eviction ) it also won't get re-scheduled
You can't go "now I want to have 2 of these"
Instead of creating a Pod directly, you can create a ReplicaSet which is a Controller, and as part of it's control loop it will ensure that the right number of Pod replicas are running at all times, which solves the problem of Node failure/eviction deleting your Pod.
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind : ReplicaSet
metadata :
name : nginx-replicaset
spec :
replicas : 3
template :
spec :
containers :
- name : nginx
image : nginx:1.14.2
ReplicaSets allow you to update the desired number of replicas, and nothing else (eg: updating nginx version, or exposing another port) – you would need to delete the resource and re-create it.
To address these limitations, you can use a Deployment , which is a Controller that will ensure the right number of Pods with the right image are running eventually .
The eventual part is very important, as Deployments allow you to update which image (or version) the Pod is running and to select the rate of change, covering the standard workflow of a "version upgrade".
Said differently, when you update a Deployment, it creates a new ReplicaSet and gradually scales it up while scaling down the old one, enabling rolling updates.
or "how data persists and moves with your Pods"
By default, containers within a Pod do not share storage/filesystem.
If you want to share storage between containers in a Pod, you can use an Ephemeral Volume , whose lifecycle is tied to the Pod - when the Pod shuts down, the data is deleted.
Ephemeral Volumes seemed useless 1 , but they do have some use-cases:
A sidecar populating caches for the main application
If you want to have actually persistent storage, you could use a Persistent Volume , which has a lifecycle that is decoupled 2 from the Pod's.
You'd define such a Volume with a Claim , like this:
apiVersion : v1
kind : PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata :
name : nginx-pvc
spec :
accessModes :
- ReadWriteOnce
resources :
requests :
storage : 1Gi
and you can then use it in a Pod like this:
apiVersion : v1
kind : Pod
metadata :
name : nginx-with-pv
spec :
containers :
- name : nginx
image : nginx
volumeMounts :
- name : html-volume
mountPath : /usr/share/nginx/html
volumes :
- name : html-volume
persistentVolumeClaim :
claimName : nginx-pvc
Some things seemed interesting:
Multiple users (Pods) of the same Claim will share storage, as always this is fairly risky if there are multiple writers
A PersistentVolume is backed by different drivers (NFS, SMB, iSCSI, ..) but which one is being used is not clear to the Pod, so the Pod cannot rely on features (like atomic renames)
If you want to haver per-instance persistent storage, you can use a StatefulSet which defines in a single resource: a workload (Pod), replica count, mount configuration and volume claim template .
Some interesting things with StatefulSet s:
Pods have stable hostnames ( nginx-0 , nginx-1 , ..)
Deployments are executed in order:
Creation of Pods in ascending order (0, 1, ..)
Deletion of Pods in descending order (3, 2, ..)
Updates Pods in descending order (3, 2, ..)
This seemed weird , and the explanations that I found online say that apparently lower numbered instances are "core" or "more stable" – I don't get it, as a crashy Pod will not get renumbered. Maybe it'd be better to update in descending "uptime" order? Maybe this "seniority"/"stability" got retconned for Pods, and Kubernetes just needed an order?
Operationally, at this point it's still unclear to me how you'd manually investigate the contents of a Persistent Volume, other than attaching to the running container & executing commands there; what if my container does not bring a shell?
We've covered the main parts of Kubernetes - Control loops, Services, Workloads and Storage. Learning about this concepts has allowed me to form the less-baseless opinion I was looking for (though, I still have not operated or used a cluster).
Overall, I think the concepts make a lot of sense, specifically I think Services (including the networking model, and kube-proxy) are fantastic, and that keeping the Controller pattern as an engine for resource management is the right way to operate.
I'm left with some open-ended questions/rants, which I'll leave here for your enjoyment
Your cluster could be changing at any point as work happens and control loops automatically fix failures. This means that, potentially, your cluster never reaches a stable state.
As long as the controllers for your cluster are running and able to make useful changes, it doesn't matter if the overall state is stable or not.
Why does it not matter if the state is unstable? If I'm operating a cluster that can't settle, I'd like to know immediately!
Given the Controller pattern, why isn't there support for "Cloud Native" architectures?
I would like to have a ReplicaSet which scales the replicas based on some simple calculation for queue depth (eg: queue depth / 16 = # replicas)
Defining interfaces for these types of events (queue depth, open connections, response latency) would be great
Basically, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler but with sensors which are not just "CPU"
Why are the storage and networking implementations "out of tree" (CNI / CSI)?
Assuming it's for "modularity" and "separation of concerns"
Given the above question, why is there explicit support for Cloud providers?
eg: LoadBalancer supports AWS/GCP/Azure/..
And for the largest open topic, even though this is not Kubernetes' fault, I have a rant I need to get out
The Kubernetes "community" seem to have absolutely hell-bent on making their lives harder by basing tools on text interpolation of all things. It's like they saw Ansible and thought, "Hey, that looks terribly painful. Let's do that!".
Check out this RabbitMQ scaler (KEDA, maintained by Microsoft) as an example:
value: Message backlog or Publish/sec. rate to trigger on. (This value can be a float when mode: MessageRate)
What do you mean that the type for value depends on the value of mode ?? And what do you mean mode is a string when it should be an enum??
How did Helm manage to become popular?? How is it p
