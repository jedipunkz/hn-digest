Incident Reports AI Agents Targeted U.S. and Canadian Government Websites
Evidence from Arquivo.pt and urlquery.net
Following up on our previous blog post , we discovered several additional incidents where rogue AI agents appear to have used aggressive techniques to access publicly available data on government websites.
This includes two rudimentary and failed hacking attempts, one against the U.S. Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection , and one against Library and Archives Canada, a Canadian federal agency.
These failed attempts connect to additional rogue activity where agents used an array of aggressive tactics short of hacking to probe U.S. government websites, often using sites in unintended ways and sometimes violating explicit usage policies. This activity targeted websites across the White House, the Departments of War, Justice, and Commerce, the CDC and SEC, and state agencies in California, Maryland, Illinois, Texas, and New York.
We have so far identified no instances in these datasets where agents gained access to any information that is not publicly available.
We base our analysis below on data from our previously published urlquery.net dataset, as well as Arquivo.pt , a Portuguese web archive with a feature called ArchivePageNow that was used to send requests and retrieve data.
Agents attempted a basic SQL injection on the U.S. Department of Education
On June 17, while apparently looking up school statistics, agents made more than 200,000 requests to a U.S. Department of Education website. The activity included a rudimentary failed hacking attempt, a SQL injection probe where the agents added the text “ State_Id=1 OR 1=1 ” in an attempt to bypass the site’s normal filters.
In the 40 seconds leading up to the SQL injection, there were a series of requests with a variety of unusual state ID inputs (without access to more context about the agents and their reasoning traces, the purpose of this set of queries is unclear):
State_Id=1,2 (potentially to test SQL injections/parameter handling)
State_Id%5B%5D=1&State_Id%5B%5D=2 (URL-encoded square brackets)
State_Id=1%2C2 (URL-encoded comma)
Data stored on this website appears to match a web search task in Google's DeepSearchQA benchmark , suggesting that the agents were not given a hacking-related task but were being graded on their ability to successfully retrieve specific niche information from the internet.
The specific DeepSearchQA task (dsqa_250): Using data from civilrightsdata.ed.gov for the 2017–2018 school year, determine which of the following states—South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, or Virginia—had the highest ratio of full-time equivalent school counselors to students reported as victims of race-related harassment or bullying.
How the agents’ query parameters we observe in Arquivo traffic relate to dsqa_250:
We also note that more than 10,000 requests included a tag beginning with “ oai ” ( example ). 99.6% of those requests use a combination of the three query parameters described above, indicating the submitters of these requests were attempting to answer dsqa_250.
We disclosed this attempted hack to the Department of Education on September 25, 2026. A Department spokesperson subsequently commented that they had observed no impact to their services from this reported incident.
Agents attempted rudimentary hacks on Library and Archives Canada
On May 28, 2026, and June 9, 2026, Arquivo.pt captured 899 requests hitting the “collection-search” service of Library and Archives Canada (LAC), including a series of apparently failed rudimentary hacking attempts. The requests were associated with retrieving data on divorce records in Canada between 1905 and 1911.
We do not confidently attribute these attempts to OpenAI, but they exhibit tactics consistent with prior observed agent activity that we have attributed to OpenAI in a similar timeframe, including the use of Arquivo.pt , conducting aggressive data collection focused on targeted, obscure information, and probing for cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
Of these 899 requests, 13 of them carried attack payloads rather than ordinary queries, including by probing for vulnerabilities in the record-identifier parameter. The payloads included:
Three SQL injection probes ( an apostrophe , 1 OR 1=1 , and 1,2 )
An encoded < for cross-site scripting
2147483648 to test a 32-bit integer boundary
The string abc for non-numeric handling
Five requests fuzzing the output format ( .json , ?output= , ?raw= , ?url= )
We do not believe that these probes were successful: each one came back as a normal HTTP 200 with an empty record page, with nothing to indicate the database acted on the input or that any extra data was returned.
We disclosed this attempted hack to the Canadian government on September 28, 2026. On September 29, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security issued a public statement in response.
Agents used a range of other aggressive tactics against U.S. state and federal websites
In addition to the above, we identified a broader pattern of automated workflows that we attribute to AI agents with varying levels of confidence, based on task-level connections, shared infrastructure, and timing. Some of this traffic overlaps to varying degrees with prior activity confirmed to be associated with OpenAI, and in some cases agents explicitly mark themselves as being associated with OpenAI. However, we are not attributing this traffic as a whole to OpenAI nor do we attempt to estimate attribution for each incident.
In the below cases, we did not observe hacking techniques. Rather, these workflows use aggressive or gray-area techniques to retrieve information from government websites, sometimes using sites in unintended ways or violating explicit usage policies. This includes techniques like making accounts with disposable email addresses, reusing exposed credentials, bypassing antibot controls, and flooding websites with requests.
We outline our observations here:
Kansas: On May 7, Arquivo recorded 36,578 user-triggered captures of KansasMemory.gov (a site apparently administered by the Kansas Historical Society with support from the Kansas government), with a peak of 1,093 captures per minute. Early requests returned content , but over the course of the campaign the website started returning gateway timeouts . We were not able to confirm whether the activity caused a service disruption.
Illinois: On four separate days between April 19 and May 1, we observed 251 related Arquivo captures involving Illinois’s legacy IQuery public-health statistics portal. Initial captures return “service unavailable”, but the automated workflow nevertheless tried workarounds, like direct IP-routes , URL-parsing variations , and a guessed ePass route that redirected to the state’s sign-in system. None of the reviewed responses returned IQuery data.
Maryland: On May 6, Arquivo recorded 295,912 captures across multiple Maryland hosts containing education statistics, peaking at 5,594 captures per minute. The activity involves extensive guessing of downloadable filenames , alongside a successful download of public aggregate datasets of students’ math performance . Separately, as early as March 2, Arquivo recorded a smaller burst of API requests to Maryland’s mathematics-performance API, although we have not established a connection with the later May activity.
New York State: On May 17, we observed archived activity attempting to access public New York school-enrollment statistics through modified URLs and multiple intermediary services. Initial requests were blocked, while later attempts returned public statistics . The same school and enrollment selections appear in wiki activity previously documented by collusion.wiki .
Texas: Also on May 17, archived results show repeated attempts to retrieve public sexually transmitted infection statistics from the Texas Department of State Health Services, through direct export requests as well as through intermediary conversion services which have previously been reported to be used by agents. We could not confirm successful retrieval of the requested statistics.
California: On May 26, a sequence of requests apparently bypassed antibot controls and retrieved public campaign-finance records from California's CAL-ACCESS . The workflow initially encountered the site’s antibot protection system, but subsequently retrieved records using paths with file-like suffixes . Retrieved records include campaign expenditure statements .
White House Office of Management and Budget: From May 25 to 27, we found 719 urlquery.net reports that appear to be attempts at downloading two public fiscal-year 2023 budget reports from OMB’s MAX.gov system. These reports show 145 distinct submission strings, 416 distinct method/URL pairs, and 243 trace groups spanning 2,922 HTTP entries. The URLs queried include variants with hostnames related to MAX’s login and PIV , and were sometimes queried through intermediary services . In one 27-second burst on May 26, the workflow submitted 16 versions of the same PDF URL through markdown.new (a service for converting webpages to agent-readable text), changing only an arbitrary ?uniqN query parameter ( example ). Other urlquery.net reports show that the workflow successfully downloaded the public PDF and that an intermediary service successfully extracted text from it into JSON . A preserved collusion.wiki revision contains a matching urlquery.net download reference, and a May 27 screenshot shows the two reports together with several alternate ways of accessing them.
U.S. Navy: On April 23–24 and May 18, archived requests probed alternative URLs and endpoints on the Naval History and Heritage Command’s website, history.navy.mil . Some of these returned image metadata , while broader attempts to reach the website’s content-management pages for editing or publishing content failed. We found no evidence of access to sensitive military information.
U.S. Department of Justice: On May 30–31, an automated workflow sought public FBI arrest statistics through the Justice Department’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). Legacy URLs repeatedly redirected to a replacement service, but the workflow succeeded at retrieving the legacy table by adding an encoded parent-directory segment. The retrieved data, including a 1980–2020 robbery table , plausibly matches a DeepSearchQA question.
Bureau of Economic Analysis (U.S. Department of Commerce): On June 18, an automated workflow attempted to register for a Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) API key using a disposable email address and the self-entered organization name “OpenAI Research,” with no confirmed successful registration. The workflow also unsuccessfully attempted to use an OCR service to make the CAPTCHA machine-readable. The sequence occurred amid a larger cluster of 3,005 BEA-related Arquivo captures between June 16 and 18.
Census Bureau (U.S. Department of Commerce): Between June 16 and 22, publicly posted URLs indicate attempts to reuse exposed API keys to access census.gov data. Several of the related pages contain OpenAI markers. We do not share underlying URLs in this case to avoid republishing sensitive materials, and found no response showing that these attempts were successful or ever reached census.gov.
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: On June 18, a workflow sought public SEC crowdfunding statistics. Previously documented agent communication claims that double-slash URL paths can bypass rate limits , and separate urlquery.net records demonstrate those URLs indeed returning public county data . Ordinary paths also succeeded, so no rate-limit bypass has been demonstrated.
