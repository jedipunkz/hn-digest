Primitives for Sane Conversation About AI
Think about how much pure energy, in the form of human brain-power, has gone into arguing about AI. This post will consume some, all of Reddit, Hacker News, Facebook comment threads, conversations between co-workers, upcoming tryptophan-fueled Thanksgiving debates... It's substantial.
Part of this is just because, well, people like to argue. And hey - that's fair. I am not here to criticize that even remotely. Arguing is a time-honored human tradition, and an important tool of intellectual (and emotional) progress. However, perhaps we could argue about deep or meaningful things, instead of pointless semantics.
With that in mind, here is my primer for how to have a productive argument about AI, topic-by-topic:
"It's not AI, it's just machine learning"
Correct - no one cares. Usually people mean "it's not AI because it's not AGI", though (see below).
"It's not AGI because:" or "it's AGI because:"
Useless conversation ultimately because AGI means something different to everyone. And it has for a long time, even before the current LLMs. There are a few different places where AGI arguments smuggle in terms without saying them explicitly. I'd recommend clarifying the following before engaging in any debate about whether AGI has arrived:
AGI != consciousness. Well, in the strictest definition of the term, this is correct. But for some people, AGI does mean consciousness, if only that they are inseparable.
AGI != omnipotence. See "ASI" (artificial super-intelligence). Well, again, for some people AGI does mean omnipotence because they are imagining some omnipotent sci-fi computer.
AGI != limitless scale. Again perhaps see ASI, but I think there is this image in a lot of people's heads that AGI = sci-fi supercomputer/Skynet type thing. Whereas in principle, you could probably have an AGI with very limited attention. We'll revisit attention because it's interesting and actually what people are often arguing about. But you could have an AGI running on a Raspberry Pi that just takes a year to compute a very, very accurate token.
"If you had ASI everyone would know because you would have limitless power/wealth/influence/success"
This one smuggles in some more preconditions. See, for instance, Stephen Hawking. Undoubtedly one of the smartest human beings to ever live, but again, not all powerful, not the most successful person to ever live, not the richest person to ever live. We consider intelligence primarily in domains of things like reason, language, and math. LLMs can master those, even to the point of being ASI, without ever becoming skynet, for all the same reasons that Hawking couldn't think his way into walking again. Opportunity, accessibility, and physical constraints matter significantly, regardless of intelligence. Don't let claims about ASI smuggle in claims about interface with the physical world.
"AI is smarter than $ expert_in_field based on $ recent_discovery.
This is a tricky one. From first principles, an LLM can't ever really be smarter than its training data. But what trips people up is the problem of attention, and also of persistence. If you took Terence Tao, cloned him millions of times, and pointed all those clones at the Navier-Stokes problem, for sure he'd solve it eventually (or one of his clones). But Terence Tao can't be cloned, and he needs to eat, sleep, have time off, and generally is capable of getting bored. LLMs more or less need none of those things, and can "brute force" their way to solutions with limitless thinking of roughly state of the art human level intelligence.
Don't let this one devolve into an argument about whether LLMs are capable of more complex thinking than humans, when it really should be an argument about whether or not LLMs are capable of thinking a lot more about complex things than humans.
For a more concrete point: I have a PhD with a number of original publications that moved (however slightly) a couple of different fields forward from the known to the unknown. There is literally no reason I did this vs anyone else, other than that I decided to give those things attention when no one else did. Not because I'm smarter and was needed. If anything, because I wasn't smart enough to be expensive, and that freed me up to look at less critical problems.
$ little_model can't ever be as good as $ big_model because it doesn't have as many parameters" or "It doesn't have as much knowledge but it can reason just as well/knowledge and reasoning are two different things"
OK, first of all, in 1 to 2 years, ALL models, regardless of size, will be obsoleted by much much smaller models. So ask yourself if you really want to have this specific argument. This is based on simple extrapolation of curves, and even if the curve suddenly flattens, I feel pretty comfortable about the amount of buffer in 1-2 years for flattening to still allow this prediction to come true.
But also, consider this: If a model has zero parameters, can it have reasoning? Right now, that answer seems to be a pretty resounding no. You need a network of some sort. OK so then this argument is actually about whether reasoning is a specific, discrete neural network, that emerges from large parameter sets, or something more akin of compression. The thought being that smaller models have simply trained better/found the parameters that matter, tossed the crap, and that's how they outperform older big models. Neither can resolve this question right now, so don't fall for it. (The real answer is that intelligence is tuned into, not emergent, but that's another post for another day).
This one is tricky because the dangerous LLM that everyone is arguing about is quite scary. What if, for instance, Claude somehow got the nuclear launch codes, and set them off to bring about a nuclear winter to offset climate change? (I have no idea if that's how it works). And then people will argue both why this totally inevitable, and also why this is not remotely possible.
Look - I don't know what the answer is. But I do know that "Claude" does not exist as an entity, it has no state between calls. It is an autoregressive token lookup function - and hey, maybe that is consciousness (or how we get there) but the point is that it can't make my grocery list without having to run multiple compactions because it hits context limits.
Rather than arguing about whether some fantastical AI/AGI/ASI/LLM is Skynet, the real question here needs to be "what is the precise implementation of an LLM that could be dangerous, and does that exist/is it likely to exist on this trajectory?". It is remarkably unclear to me, every time that this topic comes up (which is not infrequently), what the implementation is that is being argued could occur, and most of my naive assumptions about what it would have to be fail very basic assumptions (like: unplug it, turn off the internet, stop putting coal in the power generators, a gun, etc etc).
Good, we've separated out consciousness from intelligence now. Unfortunately, there's no way to answer this question from within the box. I highly recommend trying on this one though.
