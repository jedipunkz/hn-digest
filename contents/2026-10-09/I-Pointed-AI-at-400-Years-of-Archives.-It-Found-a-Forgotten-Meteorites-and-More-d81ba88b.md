I Pointed AI at 400 Years of Historical Archives. It Found a Forgotten Meteorite, Lost Rhinos, and Unrecorded Volcanic Eruptions.
How I used AI to investigate millions of historical records and surfaced a forgotten meteorite report, three lost rhinos, and unrecorded volcano eruptions.
Last week, on October 1st, 2026, the historian Benjamin Breen published a post called
Using Opus 5.5 to discover a new eyewitness account of the dodo .
He used AI to search digitized records from the Dutch East India Company. The Company dominated the spice trade and ran a string of ports across Asia from 1602 until it collapsed under its debts and was dissolved in 1799.
A project called GLOBALISE has turned millions of the Company’s handwritten pages into searchable text. Searching those transcriptions with AI, Breen found a 1615 ship’s journal in which sailors on Mauritius “caught many tortoises, dodos”. A new eyewitness record of the extinct dodo, sitting in plain sight for four hundred years.
I read the article and immediately thought, I can do this.
Not because I’m a historian, but because I’m a software engineer who happens to be very adept at piloting AI agents and creating agentic workflows. Breen’s post was the
inspiration, and I wanted to extend the approach: I could search for many different historical mysteries in parallel, and I could
chain together a few different AI models to weed out the false positives that were bound to come up.
But the appeal went beyond the technical challenge. I think there’s something honorable about adding to what we know. Adding even one new data point to a couple of niche fields felt like a small but worthwhile contribution to make. I thought it would be really cool if I could do that.
I powered on my small but capable home AI lab and got to work.
I started by asking an AI “Deep Research” assistant a question: which open historical questions are most likely to be solvable with data
that already exists online? It came back with thirteen candidates, ranked by how complete and accessible the data was, how much AI could
help, whether anyone had already done it, and, most importantly, whether an answer could be checked against an original page. That last one matters more than it sounds. AI
models can be confidently wrong, so every claim had to end at a real document: a scan of the actual handwritten letter or the actual
printed newspaper, with an archive reference that anyone can look up and read for themselves. The list
included animals in the Dutch East India Company archives, a giant volcanic eruption from 1808 that nobody has ever located, felt
earthquakes in old Dutch newspapers, unrecorded meteorite falls, and ships that completely vanished.
Then I teamed up with Claude Code, Anthropic’s AI tool, and we invented this research pipeline together.
First came the reading material: the GLOBALISE transcriptions of the Dutch East India Company archive (4.35 million pages,
from the 1600s to the 1790s), the Dutch national library’s digitized newspapers, two centuries of American newspapers, and a few ship
logbooks for good measure.
If I sat down to read just the Dutch East India Company pages myself, at two minutes a page, eight hours a day, five days a week, it
would take me about 70 years. And that’s before the newspapers. The machines got through the whole Company archive in a single
twelve-hour overnight run.
The trouble with old documents is that nobody spelled anything the same way twice. Handwriting and old print come out of text
recognition full of errors, and 17th-century Dutch spells “rhinoceros” about fifteen different ways. A plain keyword search would miss
most of what I was looking for. That overnight run was my graphics card turning every passage into a mathematical fingerprint of its meaning, 5.7
million passages from the Dutch East India Company archive alone. That let me search for what a passage was
about, not just which words it happened to use.
Even then, a single search could return tens of thousands of hits, far too many for a person, or even a big AI model, to read
affordably. Instead, the first read went to a tiny, fast “System One” decision model called Jev, which
answers only narrow questions: Is this a real animal? Is it wild? Where is it? It costs a few cents per million words. Having it read
59,000 mentions of elephants cost me about three dollars.
That’s the part of this project I’m proudest of, and it was my idea, not the AI’s. When I proposed using Jev as a filtering mechanism, Claude Code’s Fable model didn’t yet know what a System One type decision model was; I had to explain the idea before we could build the pipeline around it. In most research like this, the bottleneck is a person reading candidate passages one by one and deciding which are worth a closer look. Putting a cheap, fast judge in that seat automated the initial screening and freed me to focus on the strongest candidates and the direction of the investigation. The pages I examined closely had already survived two rounds of machine reading.
Only the passages Jev flagged moved on. Claude Haiku, a bigger model, read those few dozen closely, translated them and pulled out the
dates and places. Then the Claude Code agent opened the scan of each original handwritten page to check the transcription against the original. Before calling anything new, I checked it against the catalogues the specialists themselves use.
A quick note on how AI was used in this project: I stayed actively involved in the discovery process throughout. I steered the investigation toward new questions and sources, decided which leads were worth pursuing, and recognized when I was grasping at straws and needed to move on. The systems could search and read at a scale I couldn’t, but deciding where to go next, or when to stop, still took my judgment. This was AI-assisted research, not a completely autonomous investigation.
There was one more rule, and it mattered most. Before you trust a search that finds nothing, you have to prove it can find something you
already know is there. So before I went looking for anything new, the pipeline had to find Breen’s dodo, the Laki eruption of 1783,
Tambora in 1815 and a dozen other known events.
It’s like testing a metal detector by burying your own wristwatch in the front yard. You know it’s there. If the detector can’t find it, an empty sweep of the rest of the yard doesn’t tell you much. These known historical events were my buried wristwatch: a way to check that the pipeline could find something before taking its failures to find anything seriously.
The controls passed. Then the search started surfacing pages that may not have been read by anyone since the clerk who originally wrote them filed them away, stories that human eyes may not have read in hundreds of years.
The first real find of the project came from somewhere I didn’t expect: a newspaper printed in Batavia (today’s Jakarta). Batavia sits on Java, the large
island in what is now Indonesia that was the centre of Dutch power in Asia for nearly two centuries, and the newspaper was
printed there during the few years (1811–1816) when Britain, not the Netherlands, ran the island.
On 19 December 1812 the English-language Java Government Gazette reprinted a letter from the Bombay Gazette of 26 August. An officer
with a British force camped near Pandharpur, in what is now Maharashtra, wrote home:
“Captain M— is in possession of a great curiosity viz. a stone precipitated from a Thunder-cloud near the village of Cokurrgaum three
days ago (the 6th August). It weighs I should think four pounds at least, is very heavy for its size, being greatly impregnated with
iron, and coated with a thin black crust, as if Gunpowder had exploded around it.”
The thunder was heard “like a rustling fire of Musquetry for about half a minute.” The stone had buried itself a foot deep in open ground.
And it was recovered “with some difficulty, as the Pattell [the village headman], conceiving the stone of Heavenly fabrication, had
determined to say his prayers to it, with due regularity.”
Booming, a heavy iron-rich stone, a thin black crust, a crater in a field: that’s a textbook meteorite fall. And it isn’t in any
catalogue. I checked six of them, from Chladni’s pioneering list of 1819 through the British Museum’s catalogues and the 1933 List of
Indian Meteorites to today’s Meteoritical Bulletin. I used AI to search a hundred digitized periodicals from 1812–1817 for a follow-up, but found
none. The stone isn’t in the Natural History Museum’s collection either.
If confirmed, the meteorite fall I uncovered would be the earliest recorded in Maharashtra, predating the earliest known record by 26 years.
I love how fragile the chain is. A stone falls in the Deccan. An officer writes a letter. A Bombay paper prints it. A ship carries the
paper to Java, which happens to be British for five years, where an editor needs to fill a column. Copies end up in a Dutch library, which
digitizes them and releases them for free. Two centuries later a GPU in my office rediscovers it. Take away any one of those links and the
meteorite is gone from history.
The rhinos that never reached the king
In 1738, somewhere in the forests outside Batavia (today’s Jakarta), men working for the Dutch East India Company caught a live Javan rhinoceros.
It was meant as a present. Every year the Company sent an embassy with gifts to the King of Kandy, the ruler of Sri Lanka’s highland kingdom, whose goodwill kept the cinnamon flowing. The king loved large, impressive animals. So Batavia’s letter to the Netherlands that year lists, among the rarities sent to the king, “yet another rhinoceros which one has had caught here in the forests, and likewise sent over.”
The rhino made it across the Indian Ocean to Colombo. It never made it up the mountains to Kandy. In the Company’s accounts, under the heading De Paardenstal , “the horse stable”, there is a line written off in 1740:
“1 rhinoceros short, died in the horse stable in the year 1738.”
In March 1739 the governor in Colombo wrote to Batavia, a little sheepishly, that the rhinoceros “died very suddenly”. To make up for it, he had added a fine Persian riding horse to the king’s gifts, “to please the King’s so often shown fiery desire for such large and stout horses.”
Batavia tried again. On 5 July 1740 the ship Loverendaal sailed from Batavia for Ceylon with two rhinoceroses aboard, a male and a female. Three days out, the officers, boatswain and gunner gathered before the ship’s bookkeeper and swore a statement: despite “all trouble and diligence” to keep the two rhinoceroses alive, the male had died that morning, “at about eight o’clock.” Ten days later they swore a second statement. The last of the two, the female, ‘t wijfje , had died too.
The crew’s statements were read back to them before the court in Colombo, and they “persisted in them without wishing the least change.” Then the governor had to tell Kandy. His instructions to the envoys at the king’s court, dated 16 September 1740, are almost touching. He had found the king some Dutch pigs, “a boar and two sows, all still young animals that will surely grow considerably, especially the little boar.” He would gladly have met the king’s request for dogs, had any been obtainable. And the envoys should let the court officials know, “so that they can answer if asked”, that the two rhinoceroses sent from Batavia on the Loverendaal had both died on the voyage, “to our particular regret.”
The king, it seems, had been expecting them.
Three years later, Dutch envoys at the court of Ramnad in southern India were asked, in a tone they found impertinent, to arrange for “a young rhinoceros to be sent, as was done for the King of Kandy.” The gift that never arrived had become something other rulers wanted.
