Two Futures for LLMs in Mathematics
This week, we've seen two very different approaches to LLMs for
math/theoretical computer science.
In one corner, Anthropic dropped a result to Josh Alman
(Columbia) and his former advisor at MIT, Virginia Williams,
who are both known for having shown that matrix
multiplication could be done slightly more cheaply than
previously thought. They did so through very careful counting
of how many operations were actually needed in various parts of
the existing "laser" method of matrix multiplication, finding that
you could shave off a hair here and there.
These two researchers looked at the result from Anthropic and turned it into a fully-fleshed-out
paper . The new paper wasn't a matmul result directly; it was a way to use a particular
flavor of matrix product to break some bounds that had held
so long people were starting to build theory around their
hardness, such as 3SUM:
3SUM: Given a set of n numbers, decide whether any three of them sum to zero.
For decades, nobody could figure out how to do 3SUM faster
in sub-quadratic time, i.e., something like
O( n 2 - e ) time for some value of e > 0, though we hadn't specifically proved
that it needed it.
This new paper showed that it doesn't.
The work has a very similar feel to some of their previous matrix
multiplication work, in the sense that it's also using very
careful counting of operations to drop things from O( n 2 ) to
O( n 1.9992 ). That beats O( n 2 ) by only a tiny
hair, but that hair is important, because it means our assumptions
were wrong, and a bunch of other previously-conjectured hardnesses
were reduced along with it using the same technique. This
is quite a big result in its subfield.
In the other corner, OpenAI dumped
a repository of over 700 PDFs of highly varying quality, some
with accompanying Lean proofs, some without, few with clear human
review. Some of the claimed results are nearly breathtaking, if
they're true. One that jumped out was about matrix multiplication, the
area of expertise of the above two researchers. The straightforward
way of multiplying matrices is O( n 3 ) for two square n × n matrices:
You have n 2 output cell values, each of which results from the dot
product of two size- n inputs (requiring n multiplies). But we've known
for a while there's some redundant computation in there; that
exponent, which we term omega (ω) is less than three, but it's unknown
exactly what it can be. There have been a series of
series of some practical and mostly theoretical optimizations that resulted in the previous
state-of-the-art upper bound, the somewhat ungainly O( n 2.371177 ).
OpenAI's PDF claims to reduce ω to 2.25, or 9/4.
This would be several things. First, it would be literally the largest reduction we've seen
since Schönhage's reduction to 2.522 in 1981; second, the first
"large" reduction at all
since Coppersmith and Winograd brought things to 2.3755 in 1990.
And it would be incredibly satisfying to have something that's a
rational number bound of 9/4, not the least because it seems more
likely to me to intuitively illustrate some missed structure in the problem.
Allow me to illustrate these papers with a few snippets from the
introductory material of the papers. Take a peek and read them, asking
if you understand what they're saying. From Alman
and Williams:
3SUM: Given n numbers, decide whether three of them sum to 0. This
is a classical problem with a long history, and it is central to computational
geometry (see [GO95]). Despite many decades of research, the O( n 2 )-time algorithm taught in
algorithms classes has only been sped up by polylogarithmic factors [BDP08, GP18,
Cha20].
The exponent ω of matrix multiplication over ℂ is the infimum of the
real numbers τ such that, for every ε > 0, two n × n matrices
can be multiplied in O ε ( n τ + ε ) scalar
arithmetic operations. The dimension n tends to infinity; the
algorithm and its constants may depend on ε.
I mean, true, but this is not how you'd write the first paragraph of a
paper written for humans. Contrast that with one of Williams'
human-written papers about the same topic:
Multiplication of matrices is a fundamental algebraic primitive with
applications throughout computer science and beyond. The study of its algorithmic complexity has been a
vibrant area in theoretical computer science and mathematics ever since Strassen’s [Str69] 1969 discovery
that the rank of 2 by 2 matrix multiplication is 7 (and not 8), leading to the first truly subcubic,
O(n2.81)-time algorithm for multiplying n × n matrices. Fifty-five years later, researchers are still attempting to
lower the exponent ω, defined as the smallest real number for which n × n matrices can be multiplied in O(nω+ε) time
for all ε > 0.
I can read that! I like it! I want to read more!
And the OpenAI paper is rife with things I find confusing. For example,
consider this line:
We write products either by juxtaposition or by ⊗. The zero tensor is
0, the scalar tensor xyz is 1, and the integer m ≥ 0 denotes
the direct sum of m copies of 1. Thus mA = A ⊕ m .
I think this is intentional use of the notation, but as a human, when
you introduce a symbol to me and then use a tiny-font subtly different
symbol in the next line that you've never introduced, my head hurts a
little. (Note that they introduced circled-times and then used
circled-plus in their explanation of the integer-matrix product). And
their notation there is confusing overall to me.
This is one example of many, and probably one of the better-confidence ones at
that, given that at least this one has a Lean version that proves
something (what it proves I am not yet certain—does it
prove the 2.25 result? That's going to take some time
and expert evaluation). The internet is aflutter with people
finding flaws in these papers; three of them have already been
withdrawn due to errors that rendered them invalid. The writing in
these PDFs is very AI-slop-feeling.
I like to point out that when you write, you're responsible for making
sure your audience understands what you've written. There's one of you
putting in some time, and potentially thousands of people reading what
you've written. Their collective effort to understand you is far
higher than the time it takes you to be clear.
And the same thing applies here, but perhaps at 100x magnification: Thousands of
people will have to waste time reading this dump and possibly trying to
determine if it's correct, and that's really hard work. That time would have been much better spent
by having an expert or two review, revise, and present the material
cleanly before throwing an unfiltered dump at the world.
We've seen two ways of having your internal advanced AI interact with
the world of research, and I know which one I prefer: The one that
produced a human-centered result that was informative and interesting
to read and where I have much higher confidence I didn't waste my time
reading something broken.
