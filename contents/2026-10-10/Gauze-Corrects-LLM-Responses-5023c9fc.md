llm-gauze is an HTTP gateway that sits in front of a local LLM (served via an
OpenAI-compatible API) and works around its shortcomings: transient errors
without retries, silently hung or looping models, empty or sloppy responses,
context-window overflows, runaway reasoning, and malformed tool calls. It
logs every exchange and remediates what it can before the client ever sees
it.
llm-gauze ships as a published container image and runs with Docker Compose.
Point LLM_BASE_URL in .env at your local LLM's OpenAI-compatible
endpoint (default http://host.docker.internal:14434 , which reaches a
host-side LLM on port 14434 from inside the container).
docker compose up
This runs the published image ghcr.io/ggeorgovassilis/llm-gauze:latest
(defined in docker-compose.yml ). To pin a specific release, override the
tag — for example ghcr.io/ggeorgovassilis/llm-gauze:7 .
The gateway listens on http://localhost:9317 and exposes an
OpenAI-compatible API (e.g. POST /v1/chat/completions ), forwarding to the
LLM_BASE_URL in .env .
The gateway appends the client's request path to LLM_BASE_URL . For Hetzner
Inference, set LLM_BASE_URL=https://inference.hetzner.com/api and point a
chat-completions client at http://localhost:9317 so /v1/chat/completions
reaches /api/v1/chat/completions upstream. Do not include /v1 twice or use
the provider's website root as the API base.
After changing .env , recreate the service; restarting an existing container
does not reload its environment:
docker compose up -d --force-recreate gateway
For local development, use
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build --force-recreate gateway .
Check /health afterwards: its upstream must show the intended API base,
including /api for Hetzner. Rebuilding an image alone does not correct a
wrong value in .env .
For VS Code Copilot custom endpoints, explicitly select
provider-level apiType: "chat-completions" for both the direct provider and
gateway entries.
The direct entry's URL is https://inference.hetzner.com/api/v1 ; the gateway
entry's URL is http://localhost:9317 . Supply the provider's bearer token in
the client's Authorization request header; the gateway forwards it unchanged.
Never put credentials in committed configuration.
The current Copilot customendpoint implementation gives an explicit
Authorization request header precedence over its provider API key. Without
that header, the provider API key must be the real token, not a placeholder.
An upstream HTTP 200 without completion choices is not a successful model
reply. With streaming remediation enabled, the gateway reports HTTP 502 with
invalid_upstream_response rather than fabricating a completion or an empty
SSE success. Check the upstream API path and streaming support first. Upstream
HTTP errors retain their status and body.
For an immediate VS Code 502, inspect data/records.jsonl structurally rather
than dumping recordings or private conversations. Match the client's
x-request-id in request_headers to the gateway's request_id , then compare
the record timestamp and attempt duration with container completion logs.
GitHubCopilotChat in the user agent distinguishes VS Code traffic from smoke
probes. A recorded invalid_upstream_response is a gateway protocol rejection,
not evidence that the provider returned HTTP 502: the rejected upstream status
and content type are not retained in that record. Verify the running API base
and compare a synthetic request directly when those details are needed.
The Hetzner website-root route has returned HTTP 200 with nine non-SSE bytes
and application/octet-stream , producing this immediate rejection even for
a valid chat-completions request with tools.
Temporary Compose overrides do not persist an .env correction. Before using
the ordinary start command again, privately set the correct LLM_BASE_URL
and recreate the gateway. A corrected route alone does not prove a model
can complete the VS Code workflow. Compare the relevant request shape,
including tools, message roles and stream_options , not just an OK-only curl.
Use synthetic content and bounded time/output for live probes, and report any
added token cap as a difference from the recorded request.
If authenticated generation still times out, compare the same small request
directly against the provider. Record time to response headers and first SSE
data separately from total duration: no response headers is not evidence of
ongoing reasoning. Authenticated /models discovery proves API reachability
and token acceptance, but not model readiness. A successful completion from
another advertised model with the same token helps isolate a model-specific
provider failure; report that comparison to the provider rather than silently
changing models or treating a gateway health check as successful generation.
The container runs as your host user ( UID / GID , default 1000 ) so the
files it writes to the bind-mounted data/ directory are owned by you, not
root. If a data/ directory was created earlier as root, fix ownership once
before the non-root container can write to it:
sudo chown -R " $( id -u ) : $( id -g ) " data
Health check
curl http://localhost:9317/health
Returns {"status": "ok", "upstream": "<LLM_BASE_URL>"} when the gateway is up.
Operational metrics are exposed at /metrics (Prometheus text format, or JSON
with Accept: application/json ).
Every setting is documented in docs/configuration.md .

When the model misbehaves, llm-gauze detects it and remediates what it can before
you ever see it — retrying transient failures, nudging empty replies, cleaning
leaked thinking tags, breaking loops with varied sampling:

participant C as Client
participant B as llm-gauze
participant L as Local LLM
C->>B: POST /v1/chat/completions
B->>L: forward
L-->>B: error, hang, loop, or sloppy reply
B->>B: detect & classify
B->>L: remediate (retry / nudge / repair)
L-->>B: clean completion
B-->>C: chat.completion

See docs/architecture.md for the full design and
docs/configuration.md for every setting.

and adding a detector or remediation.
